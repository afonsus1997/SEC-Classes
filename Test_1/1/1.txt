a)

For a break even scenario, the total of sales would be equal to the total cost.

The total sales is the area of the triagle, (15*3)/2 = 22.5E6
The total cost is Volume * UnitaryCost + NRE = 10E3 * 1E3 + 2E6 = 12E6
For the provided scenario, the margin is 22.5E6 - 12E6 = 10.5E6

For the break even scenario, the Lost revenue shoud be equal to the margin (10.5E6)
This means that the area difference between the on-time trianlge and the delayed bread even triangle would be equal to 10.5E6

A (0;15;3)
B (d;15;h)

10.5E6 = (15*3)/2 - (15-d)/h

15 -- 15-d
3  -- h

h= (3*(15-d))/15

10.5E6 = (15*3)/2 - ((15-d)*((15-d)*3/15))/2
10.5E6 = 22.5 - ((15-d)*((15-d)*3/15))/2
put equantion into solver (symbolab)
d=15-2\sqrt{30},\:d=2\sqrt{30}+1
only d with possible value is 15-2\sqrt{30} = 4.04



b)

A (0;15;3)
B (1;15;h)

h calculation:
15 -- 14
3  -- h     h=2.8

Area of B (revenue) = (14*2.8)/2 = 19.6

PM = [R-(NRE+V*UC)]/R
   = [19.6E6-(2E6+10E3*10E3)]/19.6E6
   = 0.388


c)
I would recommend an application specific integrated circuit with the required authentication feature build-in (e.g. security focused microcontroller with hardware hashing)

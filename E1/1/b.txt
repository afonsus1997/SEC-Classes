mem size = 32kB
word size = 8b

number of words = 32kB/8b = 32k words (1word per line)

the chip designed in a has 
    data = 8bits 
    mem size = 2^10 = 1KB

since each chip already outputs 8b, 32 chips are used

log2(32k) = 15 -> 15 address bits

to address one word from a chip -> 10 bits

to address each chip -> 5 bits

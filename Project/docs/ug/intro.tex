\section{Introduction}

\noindent
A sequencer is a device that can produce rythmic loops programmed by the user. The loop is devided into 8 equally spaced steps and each step can be activated by the user. The sequancer will go trough the loop and will play a sound on the activated steps. The loop period and the sound frequency can be set by the user.

The sequencer hardware is implemented in Verilog and uses the Picoversat SoC as the basic processing unit. Refer to the Picoversat manual for more information. 
This sequencer implementation is meant to be used on the Basys2 FPGA, and in order to make that possible, custom-made peripherals are used in order to use the board's features (e.g.LEDs, Switched, etc...). For more information is present on the peripherals chpater (insert ref).

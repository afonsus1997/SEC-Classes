\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

The developed system works as expected, everything defined in the beginning of the project was achieved. 
There were a few challenges while developing the system, nonetheless they were overcomed.
 The biggest setback was the fact that, initially the system's code was develop in C and compiled with lcc for
the picoversat. However, in the end the compiled code was bigger then the available memory. After several attempts to widen the memory
available without success, the code was re-written using Assembly. In the end it was possible to use the sequencer to produce a rhythmic pattern with varying speeds and frequencies.
The final implementation was also converted into a standalone rom file that was flashed into the boards persistent memory in order for the bitstream to be loaded into the FPGA on boot.
